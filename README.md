 An application like Yelp using both Google and Yelp data in Swift

 This application is written for iOS devices using Xcode in swift.  It integrates Google and Yelp APIs and Restful web services to list nearby places by category, show their reviews and direction to them.
 
 It uses the following APIs in swift through CocoaPods:
 ```
 Alamofire
 AlamofireSwiftyJSON
 AlamofireImage
 McPicker
 GooglePlaces
 GooglePlacePicker
 GoogleMaps
 EasyToast
 SwiftSpinner
 Cosmos
```
 It has a PHP backend server that calls Google and Yelp APIs for navigation, reviews and other info. 
 
 I have been using AWS as backend infrustructure.

 Don't Forget to replace "Google key goes here!" with your Google API key and "Yelp key goes here!" with you Yelp API key.
